          <h3 class="col-xs-8"><span class="logo-font">A Blind Journey:</span> How can we trust the Bible?</h3>
          <p class="col-xs-8">Atheist, Richard Dawkins claims that the Bible is a &ldquo;great bit of literature&rdquo; but surely it&rsquo;s not even that? A rule book written over thousands of years with a whole load of authors. Surely it&rsquo;s not even true, never mind being relevant today! Can anybody honestly trust a book like that?</p>

          <h3 class="col-xs-8"><span class="logo-font">A Pointless Journey:</span> Hasn&rsquo;t science disproved God?</h3>
          <p class="col-xs-8">It&rsquo;s as obvious as the apple falling from the tree, science and Christianity can never work together. In a world of discovery and ground breaking technology developing every day, how on Earth could someone believe in God? Can God and science ever really go hand in hand?</p>
          <p class="col-xs-4"><span class="lead">Tuesday:</span><br>Journey Tipi &mdash; 1:05pm &ndash; 1:55pm</p>

          <h3 class="col-xs-8"><span class="logo-font">A Rough Journey:</span> Where&rsquo;s God in a broken world?</h3>
          <p class="col-xs-8">Whenever we scroll through our newsfeeds, we are constantly seeing stories of pain and suffering. At some point, we will all experience the effects of a broken world &mdash; if we haven&rsquo;t already &mdash; and so where in the world is God when this happens? Forget God being good, how can He even exist with all of this going on? And how can Christians still have a faith in a good God when so much bad happens?</p>

        <div class="row">
          <h3 class="col-xs-8"><span class="logo-font">A Boring Journey:</span> Where&rsquo;s the fun in Jesus?</h3>
          <p class="col-xs-8">Sun, sex and a big suspicious God? University is so much fun, why would I swap sex and alcohol for drinking tea and singing hymns with Doris at church? That sounds like student life down the drain! Is God just one really strict parent? And can any Christian ever enjoy uni life when they&rsquo;re missing out on so much?</p>

          <h3 class="col-xs-8"><span class="logo-font">A Dead End Journey:</span> Did Jesus really rise?</h3>
          <p class="col-xs-8">What happened the days after Jesus&rsquo;s death? It&rsquo;s been a question investigated and debated by historians, private detectives and high court judges for over 2000 years. Surely the answer is obvious? People don&rsquo;t rise from the dead; it simply doesn&rsquo;t happen. Surely, to believe that, must be blind faith?</p>
